# The_Shortcut_Challenge
Contains code related to a NumPy and Pandas challenge

1. The Numpy tasks computes the row-wise counts of all uniques values in an array
2. The pandas task replaces 'NaN's with the keyword 'missing' in 1st three columns and creates an index with the same 3 columns and check if it qualifies as a primary key

To run the code, please run the code.ipynb file in Jupyter Python 3.
